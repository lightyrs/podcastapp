I hope you will find it helpful in your recovery. I decided to create this site for two reasons. One, as per OA’s 12 + 12, I seek “to carry this message to the compulsive overeater who still suffers.” And two, to use the tool of “readings” to strengthen my own recovery. As an avid podcast-listener, I was searching for an OA-themed podcast one day and was able to find many for recovering alcoholics, but none specifically tailored for recovering compulsive overeaters (Thank goodness there’s several now!). At the same time, I was looking to find a way to increase the time I spend reading, as this is a tool this extraverted OA has a hard time doing. Well, add a microphone, and ‘voila’, the OA readings podcast was created. My goal is to record readings from various OA literature as I can and post them as my schedule permits. I hope you enjoy this podcast and welcome any feedback you may have.I am eternally grateful for Mel Miller to allow me to host this anonymous podcast on her website.

practiced by anyone, in everyday life. What I do in this podcast
is touch on a technique that you can incorporate into your
tool chest of self-help strategies. In future episodes, I will discuss advanced techniques such as guided visual imagery, use of coping statements, and assertiveness techniques.

Ronald Wilson Reagan (February 6, 1911 – June 5, 2004) was the fortieth President of the United States (1981–1989) and the thirty-third Governor of California (1967–1975). Born in Illinois, Reagan moved to Los Angeles, California in the 1930s, where he was an actor, president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), and a spokesman for General Electric (GE). His start in politics occurred during his work for GE. Originally a member of the Democratic Party, he switched to the Republican Party in 1962, at the age of 51. After delivering a rousing speech in support of Barry Goldwater''s presidential candidacy in 1964, he was persuaded to seek the California governorship, winning two years later and again in 1970. He was defeated in his run for the Republican presidential nomination in 1968 as well as 1976, but won both the nomination and election in 1980.

Our favourite monarchal maniac appears by special permission of Black Raven Productions. He seems a little bit happier now than he used to! The amazing story of that crazy old Monarch from England. Poor Henry - nobody seems to like him! I wonder why. Maybe it was just bad public relations! Seems that in addition to sport, women and education, the Tudor King was also quite the writer! We think he fancies himself as a bit of a Jane Austen...Really indeed!!!?? Austen Powers more like!! Expect plenty of the writings of Henry during the series. Welcome to the wonderful world of King Henry VIII of England - the greatest Tudor of them all!

Roosevelt took office in 1933, one in four Americans was out of work nationally, but in some cities and some industries unemployment was well over 50 percent. Equally troubling were the bank panics. Between 1929 and 1931, 4,000 banks closed for good; by 1933 the number rose to more than 9,000, with $2.5 billion in lost deposits. Banks never have as much in their vaults as people have deposited, and if all depositors claim their money at once, the bank is ruined. Millions of Americans lost their money because they arrived at the bank too late to withdraw their savings. The panics raised troubling questions about credit, value, and the nature of capitalism itself. And they made clear the unpredictable relationship between public perception and general financial health—the extent to which the economy seemed to work as long as everyone believed that it would. To stop the run on banks, many states simply closed their banks the day before Roosevelt’s inauguration. Roosevelt himself declared a four-day “bank holiday” almost immediately upon taking office and made a national radio address on Sunday, March 12, 1933, to explain the banking problem. Then until 1944 FDR spoke to America as the depression gave rise to World War II.', NULL, 'Humphrey Camardella Productions', 'http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/fdr-fireside-chats-1933-1944/id317372896?uo=2&uo=2', 'FDR Fireside Chats 1933-1944', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2011-01-26 07:12:18.163242')[0m

What is New Sounds? The program, broadcast nightly on WNYC 93.9 FM, and online at www.wnyc.org, is unlike any radio show you''ve ever heard: a whirlwind tour of new and unusual music from all corners of the globe. New Sounds combs recent recordings for one of the most informative and compelling hours on radio, and aims to make the world smaller. For over 25 years, host John Schaefer has been finding the melody in the rainforest and the rhythm in an orchestra of tin cans. Defying rigid categorization and genre pigeonholing, New Sounds offers new ways to hear the ancient language of song. With guest musicians from David Byrne to Meredith Monk to Ravi Shankar to Philip Glass to Christopher O''Riley to Bang On A Can, Schaefer presents performances (both in-studio and from the New Sounds Live concert series) and premieres new works from the classic and operatic to folk and jazz, and anything else in between. Each show has a theme, ranging from post-rock to klezmer to African blues to minimalism. The variety of cultures and styles explored is boundless.
