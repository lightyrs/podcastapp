 A Passion for Communicating Biblical Truth with Excellence

Insight for Living, the Bible-teaching radio ministry of Chuck Swindoll, is committed to excellence in communicating the truths of Scripture and the person of Jesus Christ in an accurate, clear, and practical manner. Our desire is for people to grow in their understanding of God‚Äôs plan for their lives and also to mature as authentic Christians.

In the summer of 1977, the sermons that Chuck Swindoll preached at the First Evangelical Free Church in Fullerton, California, were broadcast on twenty-seven stations in the United States. Listeners responded immediately to the lively message of this down-to-earth pastor who could communicate God‚Äôs truth in terms they could understand and apply to their lives. In 1979, the radio ministry of Insight for Living was officially born, beginning on just a handful of stations. Today, more than two thousand stations carry the program around the world in seven different languages.

Insight for Living‚Äôs headquarters are located in Plano, Texas. We also maintain offices in Melbourne for our Australian listeners, in Brasilia for our Brazilian listeners, in Vancouver for our Canadian listeners, and in London for our listeners in the United Kingdom.
