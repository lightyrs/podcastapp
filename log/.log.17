Our desire is for people to grow in their understanding of God?s plan for their lives and also to mature as authentic Christians. In the summer of 1977, the sermons that Chuck Swindoll preached at the First Evangelical Free Church in Fullerton, California, were broadcast on twenty-seven stations in the United States. Listeners responded immediately to the lively message of this down-to-earth pastor who could communicate God?s truth in terms they could understand and apply to their lives. In 1979, the radio ministry of Insight for Living was officially born, beginning on just a handful of stations. Today, more than two thousand stations carry the program around the world in seven different languages. Insight for Living?s headquarters are located in Plano, Texas. We also maintain offices in Melbourne for our Australian listeners, in Brasilia for our Brazilian listeners, in Vancouver for our Canadian listeners, and in London for our listeners in the United Kingdom.

When the Dashwoods - mother Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and youngest sister Margaret - are sent, almost impoverished, to a small cottage in Devonshire after the death of their father and the machinations of their brother''s wife, they accept their new circumstances with as much cheer as they can muster even though their brother and his wife have taken over the family estate and fortune. Marianne finds herself falling in love with the dashing Willoughby, who ends up being not all that he appears. Elinor, the more sensible of the two, falls for Edward Ferrars, a match that seems much more suitable. All of these pleasant connections are, however, soon disrupted. Willoughby leaves and ignores Marianne. Elinor finds out an unexpected secret about Ferrars that puts her on her caution in pursuing their relationship. As these complications develop, Marianne soon finds herself distraught despite having attracted another suitor, the reliable, but older, Colonel Brandon. Elinor steps into the breach to try to help her sister regain her equilibrium. Both learn what a broken heart can feel like and adjust in their own separate ways. Since this is an Austen novel and a romance, be assured that all comes right in the end.

The original volumes were published as quartos, a common publishing practice of the time.The books cover the period of the Roman Empire after Marcus Aurelius, from just before 180 to 1453 and beyond, concluding in 1590. They take as their material the behaviour and decisions that led to the decay and eventual fall of the Roman Empire in the East and West, offering an explanation for why the Roman Empire fell.Gibbon is sometimes called the first “modern historian of ancient Rome.” By virtue of its mostly objective approach and highly accurate use of reference material, Gibbon’s work was adopted as a model for the methodologies of 19th and 20th century historians.

Wouldn’t it be great if our ‘good intentions’ worked the way that we think they should? Not even enthusiasm guarantees positive results. There’s often a wide gap between our intentions and our actions. We fail to take the action necessary to be in alignment with our good intentions. This can be very frustrating. 

Good intentions don’t magically lead to good results. They are a start; however, they are unfortunately not enough. This is just the truth! We all can use a little accountability in our life to help us stay focused so we can achieve all our goals in the timeframes we desire.

 Megaboom is like ‘Reading Rainbow’ with the role of Levar Burton played by a hungry bear and the children wearing meat pants. Sometimes they sing. -Moose (Womenarenotpeople.com)
 Unlike doctors or psychics, you don’t need an advanced degree to be a marginally employed, L.A. based comedian. Still, that’s not much of an excuse. -Passing Korean cart vendor (translated)

 Have you ever just wanted to know what other people are thinking and doing when it comes to sex? Let''s Get Naughty is an interactive Internet radio show discussing sex in every shape and form. No topic is too taboo or too tame. Eric and Lisa will keep you guessing with their sharp wit and irreverent conversations. And by the end of the show, you may just learn a thing or two about what it means to be a better lover. So sit back, get comfortable and Let''s Get Naughty! What makes us qualified to discuss sex on a radio show? Absolutely nothing! Neither of us are doctors, psychologists or sexperts. But, we are normal people who have been through the trials and tribulations of dating and marriage. We know sex. Good, bad and mediocre. We know what to do to enhance sex, and we know what to do to get out of having sex. The best part is that we’re not embarrassed to talk about sex! There is very little that makes either of us uncomfortable. So come on – give us a call or drop us an e-mail. We will protect your anonymity – guaranteed. We will only reveal your identity if you tell us we can on your voice mail and/or e-mail. So don’t hesitate! Write and call us today! We can’t wait to hear from you!
